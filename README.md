# neural-network-
created my own neural network, classifies images of handwritten digits  
(no TensorFlow/Pytorch, just numpy and math) 

## (No PyTorch or TensorFlow, just numpy, raw equations and linear algebra)

## Why: Getting a Deeper Understanding

interested in AI / ML but everyone knows the high level stuff

connect layers and nodes and use complex models makes cool predictions and stuff

but kind of unclear how it REALLY worksâ€¦ 

cant get much closer unless you implement it from scratch and really learn it from the ground up! 

## Problem Statement:
